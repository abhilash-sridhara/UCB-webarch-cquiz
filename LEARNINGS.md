# CUIZ â€“ Project Description

## Project Description:
Our web project CUIZ is a simple looking but insanely challenging color quiz that tests your eye's ability to differentiate the saturation of colors.
CUIZ has three web pages. The first page contains a short introduction to the game and a log-in space. When proceeding to the next page after entering the username, the user will need to click the right tile in a 4 x 4 grid for 18 rounds in 2 minutes. For each round, the color of the right tile is slightly different from the 15 other tiles, and the difficulty will increase as the user play the game. After finishing 18 rounds, the user can see his/her total score and the five top scores in the leaderboard.  

The figure below shows the different react components and how control flows between them.
